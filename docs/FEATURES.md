## 🤖 Automated Migrations (Experimental)

Scheduled automation with comprehensive safety features.

### Automation Features
- **Dry-Run Mode** - Test migrations without execution (enabled by default)
- **Scheduled Checks** - Configurable interval via systemd timer (default: 5 minutes)
- **Safety Thresholds** - CPU/memory limits, confidence scores
- **Migration Windows** - Time-based scheduling (e.g., off-hours only)

- Live error reporting in Recent Auto-Migrations UI
- Auto-refresh status every 10 seconds (no page reload needed)
- Migration log viewer with terminal-style display
- Download logs directly from the UI
- Shows VM/CT ID alongside names for easy identification

### Storage Compatibility Checks
Intelligent validation before migration:
- Automatically verifies target nodes have all required storage volumes
- Filters out incompatible targets from recommendations
- Prevents migration failures due to missing storage
- Works with both VMs (QEMU) and Containers (LXC)
- Logs storage incompatibilities for debugging

### Safety Features
Multiple safeguards for automated operations:
- **Min Confidence Score** - Only execute high-confidence migrations
- **Max Migrations Per Run** - Rate limiting (default: 3)
- **Cluster Health Checks** - Verify quorum and node status
- **Cooldown Periods** - Time between migrations per guest
- **Tag Respecting** - Honor ignore/exclude tags
- **Validation Before Execution** - Pre-flight checks

### Tag-Based Controls
Fine-grained control over automation:
- **Ignore Tag** - `ignore` - Exclude from all automated migrations
- **Anti-Affinity Rules** - `exclude_<group>` - Enforce workload separation
- **Whitelist Mode** - `auto-migrate-ok` - Opt-in for migrations only
- **Tags Bypassed for Maintenance** - Priority evacuation override

See [Automation Guide](AUTOMATION.md) for detailed configuration.

## 🏷️ Advanced Features

### Anti-Affinity Rules
Tag-based system to enforce workload separation:

**Use Cases:**
- Keep database replicas on separate nodes
- Separate firewalls from services they protect
- Distribute redundant services
- Prevent single points of failure

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Both VMs get the same exclude tag
pvesh set /nodes/pve1/qemu/101/config --tags "exclude_database"
pvesh set /nodes/pve2/qemu/102/config --tags "exclude_database"
# ProxBalance will flag if they end up on the same node
```

**Violation Detection:**
- Real-time monitoring
- Dashboard warnings
- Migration recommendation adjustments
- Maintenance mode override (for evacuations)
